# **BUDDY-MEMORY-ALLOCATION**

Welcome to **Buddy Memory Allocation**! This interactive website visualizes the Buddy Memory Allocation algorithm, which is widely used in memory management in operating systems.

The website demonstrates memory allocation and deallocation using blocks and buddies, with animations and interactive features. The visual interface allows users to see how memory is split into smaller blocks, allocated, and freed in real-time.

This project showcases a blend of animation, algorithm visualization, and user interactivity to make understanding memory allocation more intuitive.

This project was bootstrapped with **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)**.

## **Programming Languages Used**

This project is built using the following programming languages:

- **HTML** - For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS** - For styling the web pages and creating responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript** - For interactive features, animations, and dynamic memory allocation.

---

## **Features**

* **Memory Allocation Visualization:** See how memory is allocated with different block sizes.
* **Interactive Simulation:** Allocate and deallocate memory using a visual interface.
* **Block Merging:** Watch as freed blocks merge with their buddies.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive interface for desktop and mobile devices.
* **Sound Effects:** Enjoy sound effects when memory is allocated or freed.

## **Getting Started**

To run this project locally, follow these instructions:

---

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/).

---

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/tharun242005/BUDDY-MEMORY-ALLOCATION.git\
--
 
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd buddy-memory-allocation

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

---

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
