# Buddy Memory Allocation

Welcome to **Buddy Memory Allocation**! This interactive website visualizes the Buddy Memory Allocation algorithm, which is widely used in memory management in operating systems.

The website demonstrates memory allocation and deallocation using blocks and buddies, with animations and interactive features. The visual interface allows users to see how memory is split into smaller blocks, allocated, and freed in real-time. 

This project showcases a blend of animation, algorithm visualization, and user interactivity to make understanding memory allocation more intuitive.

## Live Demo

Explore the live demo of the Buddy Memory Allocation System at the following link:

[Buddy Memory Allocation](https://buddy-memory-allocation.web.app/)

## Features

- **Memory Allocation Visualization:** See how memory is allocated with different block sizes.
- **Interactive Simulation:** Allocate and deallocate memory using a visual interface. 
- **Block Merging:** Watch as freed blocks merge with their buddies.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive interface for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sound Effects:** Enjoy sound effects when memory is allocated or freed.
